//! The selector shelf, factored out of the `selector` binary so `xperience` can

//! list when no cover art is around) with a details panel, mouse and gamepad
//! navigation only (plan revision: no keyboard shortcuts, so type-to-search
//! is gone too — except for the shelf's own title filter, the one deliberate
//! exception, same as the pause book's free-text note). Cover/logo art is
//! local — dropped by hand into `assets/cover/`/`assets/logo/` (plan §4.3) —
//! matched by the ROM's file name (peeling variant tags down to the base
//! name) and decoded lazily as tiles scroll into view. The details panel itself is drawn flat by
//! `Cabinet` (plan revision: "o painel nao pode estar dentro da TV") —
//! outside the tube's warp, like the in-game side panel — so this module only
//! ever lays out the grid inside `Cabinet::shelf_screen_size`.
